# Continuous-power-flow

Initial Operating Point:

Start with an initial operating point, which is typically the base case or a known stable operating condition of the power system.
Specify the power injections (generation and load) at each bus, as well as any control settings (e.g., transformer tap ratios, generator voltage set points) that are considered constant.

Continuation Parameter Selection:

Choose a parameter, often called the continuation parameter, that will be varied continuously to explore the system's behavior. This parameter can be a control setting or an external factor

Power Flow Solution:

Solve the power flow equations for the current operating point using numerical method such as the Newton-Raphson method. The power flow equations determine the voltage magnitudes and phase angles at all buses in the system.

Increment the Continuation Parameter:

Increase or decrease the value of the continuation parameter by a small step.
Modify the power injections or control settings accordingly to maintain system balance.

Update Power Flow Solution:

Re-solve the power flow equations for the new operating point to find the updated voltage profiles.
Ensure the power flow solution satisfies the steady-state equations.
